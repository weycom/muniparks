These spaces are where transgender visitors are likely to feel the most uncomfortable. Prioritize privacy; ensure your bathrooms have stall doors, showers have curtains, etc.</p>\n<p>there should be at least one stall with a door in each bathroom and curtains or other barriers in all showers.</p>\n<h2>What are ways Parks and Rec pros can promote inclusive park programming?</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Develop a written policy of inclusion that allows participants to choose the program and the facilities that best meet their needs. </li>\n<li>Offer co-ed and non-gendered sports like roller derby</li>\n<li>Create transgender-specific programming to help these visitors learn athletic skills that were not a part of their birth-gender upbringing</li>\n<li>Connect with your local transgender community to help ensure that they are providing equitable access that meets the needs of the community.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Where can I learn more?</h2>\n<p>Learn from your peers!
