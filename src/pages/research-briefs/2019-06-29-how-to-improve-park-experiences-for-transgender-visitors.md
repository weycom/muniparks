## How can park spaces be made more welcoming for transgender visitors?

Start by assessing the experience of spaces that are often highly gendered â€“ e.g. bathrooms, pools, showers and locker rooms. These spaces are where transgender visitors are likely to feel the most uncomfortable. Prioritize privacy; ensure your bathrooms have stall doors, showers have curtains, etc.

## What are ways Parks and Rec pros can promote inclusive park programming?

* Offer co-ed and non-gendered sports.
* Create transgender-focused programming to help these visitors learn athletic skills that were not a part of their birth-gender upbringing.
* Reach out to your local transgender community to see if there are unmet needs.
