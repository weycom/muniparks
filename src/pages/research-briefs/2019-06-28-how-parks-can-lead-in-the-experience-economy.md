## What is the experience economy?

* Experiences are services made memorable.
* It’s not just a spin class; it’s “a safe space to ride through whatever you're facing” (Soul Cycle). It’s not just a room for the night; it’s “unique homes and experiences that let travelers belong anywhere” (Airbnb).
* The concept was first proposed in a <a href="https://hbr.org/1998/07/welcome-to-the-experience-economy">1998 Harvard Business Review article</a> by B. Joseph Pine II and James Gilmore – “An experience occurs when a company uses services as the stage – and goods as props – for engaging individuals in a way that creates a memorable event. And while experiences have always been at the heart of the entertainment business, any company stages an experience when it engages customers in a personal, memorable way.”

## Why does it matter to Parks and Rec pros?

* Parks and Rec pros have always been in the experience game, but now there’s a lot more competition! You need to innovate to capture value and stay relevant.
* New experience offerings can become new dedicated sources of park revenue. You can charge real money for great memories.
* Experiences can attract and retain visitors.
* Experiences can be cheaper to implement than building new park infrastructure.

## How can Parks and Rec pros lead in the competitive experience economy?

* Figure out what memories your visitors value.
* Model your programming after popular consumer experience trends – e.g. “Yoga in the Park.”
* Market experiences, not services. E.g. Many parks list out their rentable “facilities” with descriptions that heavily emphasize regulations and fees. This is a missed opportunity; these venues could easily be reframed as memorable experiences waiting to happen – weddings, parties, etc.



## What experiences can I offer that don’t require new infrastructure?

Here are a few innovative examples:

* “Screen on the Green” (outdoor film screenings)
* “Yoga in the Park”
* “Poetry in the Park”
* “Astronomy in the Park”
* “Urban Fishing”
* “Canoe under the Stars”
